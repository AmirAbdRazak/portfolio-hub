# rust-backend
backend for a rust project, maybe it would be turned into a docker container and jumbled with nextjs, or turned into some monolith leptos :D

Backend would probably end up as like a GraphQL endpoint, theres gonna be a few apps since its gonna be for a portfolio website with apps integrated in it
</br>
so main endpoints would be something like main {}, spotifyDataVisualizer {}, and the subsequent apps planned, if they ever make it
