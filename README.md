# Portfolio Web
backend for a rust project, frontend is on Svelte, runtime in Bun

# How to setup 
Just run `docker compose build` and it should run both of them. When it's ready.
Or, if you want to run them individually in their own servers (for hot reload or something)


Create a Terminal pane and run this command.
```
cd axum
cargo make dev
```

Create another terminal pane and run this command.
```
cd svelte
bun run dev
```
The servers should be running by now :D

# Todo
[ ] Implement Github Actions
</br>
[ ] Start working on the next project.
